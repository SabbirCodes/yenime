This is a **Anime Listing** Website that allows users to browse through a curated list of anime. It provides key anime details such as the title, image, and description.

## Features

- **Anime List**: Displays a list of ongoing or recently aired anime.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- **Anime Details**: Shows information such as episodes, rating, and type.
- **Modern UI**: Built with **React.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, modern design.

## Demo

## Technologies Used
